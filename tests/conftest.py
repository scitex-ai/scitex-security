"""Pytest fixtures and rootdir marker for this package.

Also performs module-import-time coverage wiring (parallel + subprocess
support). The tests at tests/examples/test_examples_smoke.py spawn child
Python interpreters via `subprocess.run([sys.executable, ...])`; without
this wiring their coverage is dropped silently.

`os.environ.setdefault` would be a no-op here because pytest-cov has
already set `COVERAGE_FILE` to a tmp dir by the time conftest is loaded.
Force-set, not setdefault.
